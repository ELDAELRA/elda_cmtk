CRAWLER_LOCALSERVER(1)
======================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
crawler_localserver - build web site from current 
directory contents and serve it over HTTP.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*crawler_localserver* 'OPTIONS'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The crawler_localserver(1) tool scans a user-specified directory, builds an
index HTML page containing URLs generated from the paths to the files, and
serves the directory using the generated index page. The tool does not include
the generated index page into the file listing.

The tool takes an optional port argument for customizing the default 8000 port
used for serving the directory contents.

The execution of the tool can be terminated gracefully by a SIGINT (Ctrl-C
pressed by the user). Upon termination, the tool deletes the generated index
HTML page. 

The tool uses the cohttp-server-async tool installed with the cohttp OPAM
package. When cohttp-server-async is absent, crawler_localserver(1) falls back
to python3 -m http.server. Thus, in order for crawler_localserver(1) to work
properly, it requires either an installation of the cohttp OPAM package (which
is a required dependency) or, if this package is missing (e.g. in case of
standalone deployment of the executable on a different machine), a standard
installation of Python 3 is required.

OPTIONS
-------
*-d*::
    Document root directory (mandatory).

*-p*::
    Port where the directory contents is supposed to be served (8000 by default).

*-t*::
    Title of the index HTML page ("Default title" by default).

*-version*::
    Print the program build version and exit.

*-help,--help,-?*::
    Print this help text and exit.

EXIT STATUS
-----------

*0*::
    Success

*Exception raised*::
    Elda_cmtk_localserver_error raised when the user-specified directory (via
    -d) does not exist. Failure when cohttp-server-async cannot be found on the
    path, and Python 3 cannot be found on the path either, or when the
    user-specified port is below 1024.
