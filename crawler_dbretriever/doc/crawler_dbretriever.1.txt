=====================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
crawler_dbretriever - interacts with PostgreSQL databases and dumps queried data into CSV

SYNOPSIS
--------
*crawler_dbretriever* 'OPTIONS'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The crawler_dbretriever(1) tool provides an interactor allowing the user to
connect to a PostgreSQL database and to perform arbitrary SQL queries on the
data. The user can also very easily dump the result of the last SQL query to CSV
files. To this end, she or he needs to do "DUMP TO filename.csv". If the results
of the queries fit the format of the two kinds of reports supported by the
crawler_dbdumper tool, viz. synthesis reports and full reports, then the names
of the columns dumped to CSV are those of the typical synthesis and full report
CSV files, as generated by the crawler_reporter tool. Moreover, the user can
also directly dump query results without printing them beforehand, as this can
be time consuming. To this end, the user needs to do "DUMP TO filename.csv OUTOF
query".

OPTIONS
-------
*--dbname*::
    Name of the PostgreSQL database to connect to.

*--password*::
    Password of the PostgreSQL user account.

*--username*::
    Name of the PostgreSQL user account to connect to the the Postgresql
    database.

*--keep-ids*::
    Keep the '__id__' column (false by default, in which case when displaying or
    dumping data to CSV, the '__id__' field is not taken into account, thus
    mimicking the structure of the CSV reporting files.

*-d*::
    Delimiter to be used in the CSV file dumps.

*-version*::
    Print the version of this build and exit.
*-help,--help*::
    Print program help and exit.

EXIT STATUS

    database).
