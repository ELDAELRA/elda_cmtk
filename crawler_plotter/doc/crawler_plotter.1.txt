NAME
----
crawler_plotter - plots per-language language pair distributions of TU counts

SYNOPSIS
--------
*crawler_plotter* 'OPTIONS'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The crawler_plotter(1) tool takes a per-language pair aggregation file (as
generated via the crawler_aggregator tool) and outputs a set of per-language
pair frequency histograms in the PDF format. The histograms are "commutative" in
that the same language pair is counted twice, as each member of a pair is
considered a source language and its histogram with respect to all other
languages is computed. For example, assuming we have the pairs English-French
and French-Portuguese, and English-Portuguese, we will have three histograms,
with the following contents: English histogram: values for French and
Portuguese; French histogram: values for English and Portuguese; Portuguese
histogram: values for English and French.

OPTIONS
-------
*-A*::
    Per-language pair aggregation file.

*-d*::

*-version*::

*-help,--help,-?*::
    Print this help text and exit.

EXIT STATUS
-----------

*0*::
    Success

*Exception raised*::
    Failure (especially IO error or ill-formed data on the input file, or IO
    errors on the generation of the output files, namely when there are missing
    dependencies).
