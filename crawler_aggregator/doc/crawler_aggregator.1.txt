CRAWLER_AGGREGATOR(1)
====================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
crawler_aggregator - aggregates information from the crawling synthetic and full reports

SYNOPSIS
--------
*crawler_aggregator* 'OPTIONS'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The crawler_aggregator(1) tool uses a pair of synthesis and full reports in
order to generate different aggregations. These aggregations can be either
per-crawled site or per-language pair. When the per-language pair aggregation is
generated, a language pair frequency matrix is also generated. This matrix is
symmetric, as the language pairs are commutative in it. Thus, only half the
matrix can be used for reliable subsequent computations.

The crawler_aggregator(1) tool can generate three output files, depending on the
user-specified aggregation type, as explained below.

When using the 'per-site' aggregation type, the tool generates a single CSV
file: 'SYNTHESIS_REPORT'_per_site_aggregation.csv

This file contains 11 columns per crawled web site entry:

- "Web site": the crawled web site

- "Provenance": provenance of the web site (viz. country if deducible from the
  web site TLD, or "Unknown (extension: {extension}) if {extension} is among
  'biz', 'eu', 'info', 'com', 'org', 'net', 'int').

- "Languages": ISO-639-1 language codes for all languages that have yielded
  TUs for the web site. The language codes are separated by ' & '.

- "Token counts": total token count for all TUs yielded by the web site,
  irrespective of their TUV's languages.

- "TU counts": total number of TUs yielded by the crawled web site.

- "Average alignment score mean": arithmetic mean of all per-language pair
  alignment score means.

- "Average alignment score variance": arithmetic mean of all per-language pair
  alignment score variances.

- "Average length ratio mean": arithmetic mean of all per-language pair
  length ratio means.

- "Average length ratio variance": arithmetic mean of all per-language pair
  length ratio variances.

- "Third-party sites TU ratio": ratio between the number of TUs coming from
  third-party sites and the total number of TUs yielded by the crawled web
  site (including those coming from third-party sites).

- "Number of distinct third-party sites": number of distinct third-party sites
  having yielded TUs, for the crawled web site.

When using the 'per-language-pair' aggregation type, the tool generates two
CSV files: 'SYNTHESIS_REPORT'_per_language_pair_aggregation.csv, and
'SYNTHESIS_REPORT'_per_language_pair_confusion_matrix.csv.

The 'SYNTHESIS_REPORT'_per_language_pair_aggregation.csv file contains one entry
per language pair. For each entry, there are 11 columns:

- "Source language": The ISO-639-1 language code of the language of the
  first TUV (as indicated in the ILSP-FC-generated TMX files).

- "Target language": The ISO-639-1 language code of the language of the
  second TUV.

- "Source language token counts": total number of tokens in the "source"
  language.

- "Target language token counts": total number of tokens in the "target"
  language.

- "Number of sites": number of crawled web sites for the "source" / "target"
  language pair.

- "Number of provenances": number of countries (plus the "Unknown" if
  applicable) of the sites yielding the TUs in the "source" / "target"
  language pair.

- "TU counts": total number of TUs in the language pair.

- "Average alignment score mean": arithmetic mean of the per-site aligment
  score means, for the relevant language pair.

- "Average alignment score variance": arithmetic mean of the per-site
  alignment score variances, for the relevant language pair.

- "Average length ratio mean": arithmetic mean of the per-site length ratio
  means, for the relevant language pair.

- "Average length ratio variance": arithmetic mean of the per-site length
  ratio variances, for the relevant language pair.

The 'SYNTHESIS_REPORT'_per_language_pair_confusion_matrix.csv file contains the
per-language pair TU occurrence counts matrix, i.e. the symmetic matrix issued
from the per-language pair TU histogram.

When using the 'both' aggregation type, all three files are generated.

OPTIONS
-------

*-a* 'AGGREGATION_TYPE'::
    Statistics aggregation type.
    Can be either of per-site; per-language-pair; both.

*-rs* 'SYNTHESIS_REPORT'::
    Name of the report synthesis report file.

*-rf* 'FULL REPORT'::
