NAME

crawler_tmxbuilder - cherry-picks TUs and builds TMX files

SYNOPSIS
--------
*crawler_tmxbuilder* 'OPTIONS'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The purpose of the crawler_tmxbuilder(1) tool is to generate TMX files
from TU metadata, enriched through sample manual validation.

The crawler_tmxbuilder-based processing involves two stages:

1. Select which TUs to aggregate in a per-site and per-language pair TMX
   file.

2. Generate TMX files with appropriate metadata. For each site and language
   pair, one TMX file is created.

Point 1 is tackled based on the ratios of the following six issue types:

- Alignment Error

- Tokenization Error

- Language identification Error

- Translation error

- Machine translated text

- Character formatting error.

For each of these six issue types, two thresholds are user-specified: an
inferior threshold (th_inf) and a superior threshold (th_sup). These thresholds
are expressed as percentages of the total number of manually-checked TUs
associated to a site and a language pair which have the error.

Three possibilities exist:

1. all of the above six error types' ratios are below the inferior threshold
   th_inf.  Then, only the TUs containing the errors are discarded and, for all
   errors, an "Unlikely" annotation is added at each TU level for each error
   type.

2. Any of the above six error types' ratios is above the superior threshold
   th_sup.  Then, no sampling information is provided and all TUs from that site
   are discarded.

3. Any of the above six error types' ratios is above th_inf and below th_sup,
   and no other error type's ratio is above th_sup. Then, only the TUs
   containing the errors are discarded and for the other TUs associated to the
   same site and language pair sampling information is provided (see the
   "metadata" aspects below), in that the "Likely" annotation is added at each
   TU level for this error type.

Point 2 is tackled based on the 1.4b TMX specification
(https://www.gala-global.org/tmx-14b), on the output produced by the ILSP-FC
crawler, and on ELDA's data validation process.

Thus, a TMX file represents the (XML) serialization of a tree structure having
three types of nodes:

- TMX nodes: there one single such node in a TMX file.

- TU nodes: there are as many such nodes as TUs in a TMX file.

- TUV nodes: there are two such nodes per TU in a TMX file.

Each such node has two types of metadata:

- "standardized" metadata (see e.g. https://www.gala-global.org/tmx-14b), which
  is encoded in XML attributes attached to the node;

- user-provided metadata, which is not standardized, and is encoded as a series
  of "prop" sub-nodes, each such sub-node having a single attribute, "type",
  which encodes the name of the metadata.

As the TMX files provided by the ILSP-FC crawler are encoded in the TMX 1.4b
format, the crawler_tmxbuilder tool will use the same format.

Thus, the attributes will be the same as those provided by the ILSP-FC, whereas
the "prop" sub-nodes will be slightly different.

We list below, for each type of node in the TMX structure, the attributes and
the "prop" elements.

1. The TMX node has only one attribute, "version": string ("1.4b") and two
   sub-elements, "header" and "body". The latter has no attribute and holds the
   TU nodes. The former holds the "standardized" attributes and the "prop"
   sub-elements.

   The standardized attributes of the "header" node are:

   - "adminlang": ISO-639-1 language code (two characters)

   - "creationdate": date-time in the format "YYYY-mm-ddTH:M:s+TZ"

   - "creationtool": string

   - "creationtoolversion": string

   - "datatype": string, MIME data type ("plaintext" in this case)

   - "o-tmf": string

   - "segtype": string ("1:1" in our case)

   - "srclang": ISO-639-1 language code (two characters)

   The "prop" elements' types of the "header" node are:

   - "distributor": string ("ELRC" in our case?)

   - "description": string

   - "availability": string ("Yes" / "No" / "Unknown")

   - "l1", "l2": ISO-639-1 language codes

   - "lengthInTUs": integer

   - "nbWordsInL1", "nbWordsInL2": integers

   - "nbOfUniqWordsInL1", "nbOfUniqWordsInL2": integers.

   - "crawledSite": string

   - "DSI": string ("ECulture", "EHealth", "EProcurement", "EJustice", "Online
     Dispute Resolution", Open Data Portal, "Safer Internet", "EESSI",
     "Other", "Not Applicable")

   The "body" node doesn't have any attribute; it contains the TU nodes.

2. The TU node has a single standardized attribute, "tuid": string
   (serialization of an integer).
  
   The TU node has the following "prop" elements:

   - "manuallyChecked": string ("true" / "false")

   - "freeTranslation": string ("Yes" / "No" / "Unknown")

   - "info": string (as provided by the ILSP-FC crawler)

   - "type": string ("1:1")

   - "alignmentErrors": string (Unlikely / Likely / Undetermined)

   - "tokenizationErrors": string (Unlikely / Likely / Undetermined)

   - "translationErrors": string (Unlikely / Likely / Undetermined)

   - "languageIdentificationErrors": string (Unlikely / Likely / Undetermined)

   - "machineTranslatedTexts": string (Unlikely / Likely / Undetermined)

   - "characterFormattingErrors": string (Unlikely / Likely / Undetermined).


   The Unlikely annotation is chosen if the relevant error type ratio is
   strictly below the lower threshold.
   The Likely annotation is chosen if the relevant error type ratio is above or
   equal to the lower threshold, but strictly below the upper threshold.
   If the relevant error type ratio is strictly above the upper threshold, then
   all TUs coming from the relevant web site are discarded.
   If either one or both thresholds are not specified, or the web site has not
   been sampled and manually validated, then the relevant error type annotation
   is Undetermined. If the site has not been sampled and manually validated,
   then all error type annotations are Undetermined.

   The TU node also contains two TUV nodes.

3. The TUV node has a single attribute, "xml:lang": ISO-639-1 language code.

   This node has the following "prop" elements:

   - "tokenCount": integer

   - "site": string holding the web site the TUV came from.
