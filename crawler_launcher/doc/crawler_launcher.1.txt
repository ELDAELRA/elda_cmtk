CRAWLER_LAUNCHER(1)
==================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
crawler_launcher - launches the ILSP-FC crawler and orchestrates the crawling process

SYNOPSIS
--------
*crawler_launcher* 'OPTIONS'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The crawler_launcher(1) uses a set of URLs and automatically creates eponymous
directories and files containing the said URLs (seed URLs), then sets up
a crawler command per URL, and finally dispatches them to the available CPUs and
runs them in parallel. To this end, the program forks itself a number of times
equal to the number of CPUs and each fork spawns a crawler process. When all
crawler processes end, the program ends. The program also prints the launched
crawler commands to the standard output.

The crawler_launcher(1) tool launches the crawling processes with the following
commands, depending on the running mode, monolingual or multilingual.

For the monolingual case::

    java -Dlog4j.configuration=file:log4j.xml -jar ilsp-fc-'version'-jar-with-dependencies.jar '-crawl|' -export -dedup -mtlen 'mtlen|0' -a elda -f -type m -lang 'language' -k -filter "'filter'" -u "'url_file'" -oxslt -dest "'destination_directory'" -bs "'destination_directory'/output_data".

For the multilingual case::

    java -Dlog4j.configuration=file:log4j.xml -jar ilsp-fc-'version'-jar-with-dependencies.jar '-crawl|' -export -dedup -pairdetect -align -tmxmerge -f -k -oxslt -type p -n 10 -t 20 -len 0 -mtlen 'mtlen|0'  -pdm "aupdih" -lang "'language_list'" -a elda -filter "'filter'" -u "'url_file'" -dest "'destination_directory'" -bs "'destination_directory'/output_data".

The crawling logs are stored in the files 'destination_directory'/log.txt in
both monolingual and multilingual crawling sessions.
The 'url_file's are generated by the crawler_launcher(1) tool, as
url_seed_file_'url'.url, where 'url' is extracted from the input CSV file
containing URLs; the "/" in the URLs are replaced with "__".
The 'destination_directory' is generated by the crawler_launcher(1) tool in the
'ROOTDIR' directory and has the same name as the 'url' in the 'url_file'.

OPTIONS

    Root directory to put the crawler results.

*-l* 'LANGPAIR'::
    Language pair, specified as 'l1,l2', or 'all'.

     the length (in terms of tokens) of the cleaned text is less than this
     value, the document will not be stored.". See also
