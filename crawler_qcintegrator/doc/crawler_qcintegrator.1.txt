NAME
----
crawler_qcintegrator - integrates human and PSI validation results

SYNOPSIS
--------
*crawler_qcintegrator* 'OPTIONS'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The crawler_qcintegrator(1) tool integrates the manually annotated linguistic
errors of the TUs, as well as the manually-indicated PSI (Public Sector
Information) status of the web site that have yielded the TUs.

This tool uses the following data sources

- full TUs database, in the format issued by the crawler_reporter(1) tool, and
  extracted in the CSV format e.g. via the crawler_dbretriever tool.

- manually-annotated TU samples, present in a textual format, as generated by
  the crawler_pprinter(1) tool. The format is as follows, for each TU

  [unique_id; alignment score; further information]
  source text
  target text
  #error annotation

  The 'alignment score' and 'further information' values are extracted from the
  "Alignment score" and "Further information" columns in the CSV holding the
  TUs. The 'unique id' is the MD5 of the values of the four fields "Alignment
  score", "Further information", "Source text" and "Target text" of each TU.

- a CSV dump (using the ';' separator) of the sources database (as obtained from
  http://cef-at-sources.elda.org).

Each TU in the full TUs database is tagged based on the following criteria:

- for each TU, if PSI scope of its source (original site) is "Yes" in the
  sources database, then append #psi_'kind' to "Further information", where
  'kind' is 'Yes', 'No', 'Unclear' or 'Unknown';

- if the TU is part of a source * language pair population that has been
  sampled, then the #sampled tag is appended to the "Further information" field.

- if a #sampled TU has been manually checked, then the #manually_checked tag is
appended to the "Further information" field.

- if a #sampled#manually_checked TU has been marked with one of the issues
  among

  #F: Free_translation; #A: Alignment_error; #L: Language_identification_error;
  #E: Translation_error; #T: Tokenization_error; #MT: Machine_translated_text,
  ??: Unspecified_error,
  the sharp sign '#' and the relevant tag description, e.g. #Alignment_error,
  will be appended to the "Further information" field.

- if the TU is not #sampled, then nothing is appended to the "Further
  information" field.

Thus, the crawler_qcintegrator(1) tool will enrich the "Further information"
field with, at the minimum, nothing, and, at the maximum, a structure like::

    different numbers in TUVs#psi_'Yes|No|Unclear|Unknown'#sampled
    #manually_checked#'Free_translation|Alignment_error|
    Language_identification_error|Translation_error|Tokenization_error|
    Machine_translated_text|Unspecified_error'.
