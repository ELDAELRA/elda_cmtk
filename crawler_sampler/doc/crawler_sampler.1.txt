NAME
----
crawler_sampler - samples TU-level reporting information

SYNOPSIS
--------
*crawler_sampler* 'OPTIONS'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The crawler_sampler(1) tool uses a full report to perform a sampling on it. The
sampling is random and customizable with respect to the percentage of the
sampling population, and to the number of sampling repetitions. The sampling
repetitions are disjoint within a sampling process. The sampling population can
be filtered by language pair, list of original web sites, and list of crawled
sites. For the original web sites, a TU is kept in the population if at least
a TUV comes from a site in the list of original web sites. For the crawled web
sites, a TU is kept if both TUVs come from original web sites whose domain name
'includes' (i.e. is a subdomain of) the domain name of the crawled web site.
The output is a CSV file of the same format as the full report, with the
repetitions separated by dashed lines.
