NAME
----
crawler_pprinter - pretty-prints CSV reporting data

SYNOPSIS
--------

*crawler_pprinter* 'OPTIONS'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The crawler_pprinter(1) tool allows to pretty-print CSV reporting data into two
ways basically: (i) each column is printed on a different line; (ii) the CSV
format of the input is preserved. For (i), we can specify a number of columns to
be printed on the same line. For both pretty-prints, the user can cherry-pick
the rows and columns that need to be pretty-printed. The user can also specify
the order of the rows and columns, thus enabling customizable "slices" through
the input CSV data. The rows and columns can be specified either ordinally or
alphabetically, individually or as ranges.

OPTIONS
-------
*-i*::
    Input report CSV file.
*--columns*::
    Column selection (all columns by default). Can be specified individually or
    as ranges, e.g. 4,2,9-11,M-P.

*--concat-first::
    Concatenate first 'n' entries into a single entry ('n' is 1 by default,
    hence no concatenation takes place).

*--linesep*::
    Entry line separator (\n, blank line by default).

*--rows*::
    Row selection (all rows by default), according to the same possibilities as
    for '--columns'.

*--seplines**::
    Pretty-print each column per line (true by default). If false, then dump the
    data in the same CSV format as the input data.

*-d*::
    CSV file delimiter, used both for input and output, when '--seplines false'
    is used (; by default).

*-o*::
    Output file. If not provided and -i 'input_file.csv' is provided, then
    'input_file.txt' is produced. If provided, then the output is saved to that
    file.

*-version*::
    Print program build version and exit.

*-help*::
    Print program help and exit.

EXIT STATUS
-----------

*0*::
    Success

*Exception raised*::
    Failure (especially IO errors related to reading the input CSV file).
